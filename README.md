# Final-project_radar_navigation
Describtion: This paper presents the SimpleCFA model, a neural network that estimates 3D human meshes under challenging conditions such as poor lighting and low visibility environments, including fog and smoke. Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) radar signals can
penetrate clothing and reflect off the human body. Also, mm-Wave has the benefit of
detecting the small movement of the human body under high-frequency conditions.This
model introduces a method for predicting human meshes using only radar signals as
input data. Furthermore, the model is designed to work with a single person


Three files are uploaded. In these files, Final11_multi_head_attention and Final11_single_head_attention are the one that not cameracalibrated. Final11_full_camera calibrated is using the vertices after camera calbration. But Final11_full_camera calibrated are still on going, has the problem with ploting meshes
